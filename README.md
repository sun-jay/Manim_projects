# Manim_projects
Animations using manim


manim is a collection of libraries and its really its own hassle to get them all together without using the docker container.

to run this code use this:   https://hub.docker.com/r/manimcommunity/manim   docker container and open the jupyter notebook

run a cell that contains:

from manim import*

then paste my code in a new cell and run

OR

make ur own code by running a cell that containes code that follows this outline



%%manim -v WARNING SOMECLASSNAME
import numpy as np
import math
class SOMECLASSNAME(Scene):
  def construct(self):
    #some animation code
